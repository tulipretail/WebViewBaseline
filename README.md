# WebViewBaseline

WebViewBaseline provides a simple starting point for any new HTML/Javascript/CSS based application that will be part of a UIWebView in a native iOS application.

What this baseline provides:

- HTML5 template
- Viewport settings to avoid pinch, scaling, resizing, etc.
- Apple-specific metadata
- Common CSS hacks to make the WebView feel more native

To make your app feel native, it's important to leave scrolling, navigation, and animation to iOS-native components.
