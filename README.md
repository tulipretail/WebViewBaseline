# WebViewBaseline

WebViewBaseline provides a simple starting point for any new HTML/Javascript/CSS based application that will be part of a UIWebView in a native iOS application.

What this baseline provides:

- HTML5 home page
- Viewport settings to avoid pinch, scaling, resizing, etc.
- Apple-specific metadata
- Common CSS hacks to make the WebView feel more native
